## Numerical solution of the Schrödinger-Poisson equation 

### Schrödinger Poisson equation
The normal Schrödinger equation describes how a wave function of a particle behaves with time and is given in equation 1 where m is the mass and ℏ the reduced Planck constant. (Griffiths & Schroeter, 2018)

\begin{equation}
i\hbar \frac {\partial u}{\partial t}
\end{equation}
