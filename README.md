## Numerical solution of the Schrödinger-Poisson equation 

### Schrödinger Poisson equation
The normal Schrödinger equation describes how a wave function of a particle behaves with time and is given in equation 1 where m is the mass and ℏ the reduced Planck constant. (Griffiths & Schroeter, 2018)

```math
i\hbar \frac {\partial u}{\partial t} =-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+Vu
```

The equation only gets a physical meaning if it is squared and integrated as shown in equation 2. After that it can be interpreted as a probability to find the particle at a given point in space. (Griffiths & Schroeter, 2018)

```math
E = mc^2
```
