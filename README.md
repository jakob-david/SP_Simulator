## Numerical solution of the Schrödinger-Poisson equation 

### Schrödinger Poisson equation
The normal Schrödinger equation describes how a wave function of a particle behaves with time and is given in equation 1 where m is the mass and ℏ the reduced Planck constant. (Griffiths & Schroeter, 2018)


$i\hbar \frac {\partial u}{\partial t} =-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+Vu$
